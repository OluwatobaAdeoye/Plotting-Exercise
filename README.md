# Plotting-Exercise
Plotting parquet file into Python

You will solve two problems using Python, with the libraries we have discussed so far (numpy, matplotlib, pandas, and pyarrow). 

#Problem 1:

Using matplotlib, plot the two points (x1,y1)=(3,5) and (x2,y2)=(7,2) and the line that passes through both points. The line must continue to the edges of the plot. (I.e., it is not just a line segment connecting the points.)

Your plot should demonstrate good style, as discussed in class, making it clear to read. 

Elements of good style may include:
Appropriately selected ranges for both the x and y axes.
Labeled and legible axes. (Font 14 for both the axis labels and labels for tic marks)
Both points and the line are clearly visible. (These may be enhanced by slightly increasing line thickness and point size.)
A black-and-white or greyscale figure. (No colour is needed, given the simplicity of the plot.)
A coordinate grid.

#Problem 2 (10 points):

Load data from the following parquet file (https://star.herts.ac.uk/~kuhn/DHV/exercises_problem2.parquet) into Python. Make nice plots presenting the data as fully as possible. 

I have deliberately not included more information about the content of the dataset or how best to present the data because this is up to you to figure out! You will be marked on your creativity and the appropriateness of your data presentation choices. To fully present the data, you may need to make multiple plots.
